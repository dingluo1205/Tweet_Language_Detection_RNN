# Tweet_Language_Detection_RNN

In this project, I build a system to identify the language of written text. The
text is taken from Twitter and there are nine Western European languages to choose from: English, Spanish,
Portuguese, Galician, Basque, Catalan, French, Italian and German. I make a generative model,
i.e., modeling p(text; language) instead of p(languagejtext) using a recurrent neural network (RNN) in Tensorflow.
